# LoRaWAN Evaluation Board for Raspberry Pi

For my third year design project, which formed part of my Electrical and Computer Engineering Degree at UCT, I designed
a pcb to use the RF-Solutions SO-868 LoRa module with the Raspberry Pi 40-pin compatible GPIO header.

The image below shows the schematic design of the evaluation board. Only the necessary lines were connected to the LoRa
module. The remaining GPIO lines were passed through to headers on around the available area on the board in logical groups.
Each header has power and ground pins. The I2C and SPI2 busses were given their own headers.

The image below shows the two-layer printed circuit board layout. Note the impedance matched track between the antenna
output of the module and the edge mount SMA port on the board. This gives us the flexibility to use different antenna
systems with the evaluation board.

The photo below shoes an assembled evaluation board. The surface mount switch mode power supply modules supply the 
Raspberry Pi with 5V and the Evaluation board with 3V3. The 3V3 rail on the evaluation board is isolated from the 3V3
generated on the Raspberry Pi. The current rating of the Pi's 3V3 is not sufficient to power the LoRa module operating
at maximum power output.
