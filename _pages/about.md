I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the University of Cape Town and run a precision agriculture business [Ackerview](https://ackerview.com) together with my co-founder. I grew up on a fruit and wine farm, was heavily involved during harvest times and developed my passion for agriculture and wine tasting there.

Programming entered my life in Grade 8 in the form of Arduino, just as mathematics olympiads caught my interest and I became heavily invested in my Scout troop. Programming, mathematics, leadership and training, and an excess of outdoor sports remain as my key interests and passions. The prior three will dominate my personal blog. I will be sure to appropriately tag posts which are subjective to my business interests and refrain from business marketing altogether.

My project portfolio will be home to descriptive posts about projects of any nature I see relevant to portray as a resume extension and for others to browse through looking for inspiration to build something or to learn from my mistakes.
